# Complaint Policy

GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED is committed to creating a safe work environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. That includes (but isn’t limited to) harassment, discrimination, violation of health and safety rules, and violence.

GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED has an open-door policy, so employees are encouraged to report work-related concerns. If something about your job is bothering you, or if you have a question, concern, idea, or problem related to your work, please discuss it with the Chief Operations Officer "thereafter" (COO) as soon as possible. If for any reason you don’t feel comfortable discussing it with the COO, feel free to raise the issue with the CEO.

Any employee who witnesses or is subject to inappropriate conduct in the workplace can report it to (info@germisa.com) or any of the GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED executives. We encourage employees to come forward with any workplace complaint, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies.

Once a complaint has been made, the executives will meet and determine how to handle it. If one or more of the executives is the subject of the complaint, the CEO will determine how to handle it. Any reports of an executive engaging in harassment or gross misconduct may trigger an outside investigator. With the employee’s permission, we may conduct a complete or impartial investigation, which may involve an outside investigator in serious cases. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible. When the investigation is complete, the company will take corrective action if appropriate. 

We will not engage in or allow retaliation against any employee who makes a good faith complaint or participates in an investigation. If you believe that you are being subjected to any kind of negative treatment because you made or were questioned about a complaint, report the conduct immediately to the executives.

Currently, GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED is too small to have an internal group or department  that can independently respond to complaints, so if the executives are named in complaints, they will do their best to hold one another accountable.  Where appropriate, the executives will engage a third party to conduct a thorough investigation and recommend corrective action, where necessary.
