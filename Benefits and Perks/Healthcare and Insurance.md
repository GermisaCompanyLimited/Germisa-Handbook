# Healthcare and Insurance

GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED’s priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and insurance.

We offer medical coverage at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED for employees and depedents only. Through National Health Insurance Policy, many plans are available to all employees, and GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED has chosen a baseline plan for which it contributes to the NHIS. The available plans range in cost, and if employees choose a plan that is more expensive than the baseline plan, they will be responsible for the difference. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through internally by Chief Operations Officer, in his office is where you can find more details about the plans, costs, and coverage.
