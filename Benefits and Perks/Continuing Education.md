# Continuing Education

One of GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED'S core values is “Be better today than yesterday,” so it’s important that we support our employees’ efforts to learn, grow, and improve. These are some of the key benefits of working at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED, and are central to our company culture.

## Training Support

GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED has a budget to support any learning activity related to the work they do at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED. This doesn’t need to be a class explicitly linked to their current role, but it should help them improve a skill that will be useful for them at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED. Each employee has an limited annual budget of that can be spent towards program fees/tuition, tickets, flights, and hotels for industry conferences, classes, mentorship programs, books, programs, videos, or other places that they feel will provide valuable learning experiences. These expenses should be discussed in one-on-ones and approved by the Chief Operations Officer, to whom the employee reports. This budget resets at the beginning of every calendar year and does not roll over.  The learning budget will be limited during the first year of implementation and for employees joining the company after the month of May in the calendar year.

Employees can also use work hours to work on learning projects, though this should be limited to four hours a week but should be sanctioned by Chief Operations Officer.
