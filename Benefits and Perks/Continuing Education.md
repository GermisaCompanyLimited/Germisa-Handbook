# Continuing Education

One of GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED'S core values is “Be better today than yesterday,” so it’s important that we support our employees’ efforts to learn, grow, and improve. These are some of the key benefits of working at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED, and are central to our company culture.

## Training Support

GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED has a budget to support any learning activity related to the work they do at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED. This doesn’t need to be a class explicitly linked to their current role, but it should help them improve a skill that will be useful for them at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED. Each employee has a limited annual budget that can be spent towards program fees/tuition, tickets, flights, and hotels for industry conferences, classes, mentorship programs, books, programs, videos, or other places that they feel will provide valuable learning experiences. These expenses should be discussed in one-on-ones and approved by the Chief Operations Officer, to whom the employee reports. This support does not roll over every calendar year. The training support will be limited during the first year of implementation and for employees joining the company in the first calendar year.

Employees can also utilise work hours to work on learning initiatives; however, this should be limited to four hours per week and approved by the Chief Operations Officer.
