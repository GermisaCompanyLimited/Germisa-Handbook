# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED will determine specified days of paid vacation every year. Employees should schedule their vacations as per days allocated to them, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least 2 weeks in advance.


Employees should report vacation and sick days to the Chief Operations Officer, who will take notice of it.

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the Chief Operations Officer about their needs for remote work, flexible time, and/or other support.
