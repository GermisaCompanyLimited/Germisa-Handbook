# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED, so in addition to the recognized [Holiday List](https://github.com/clef/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md), GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED offers 1 week (7 days) of paid vacation every year that accrues 1.25 of a day per month of work. Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.


Employees should report vacation and sick days to the Cheif Operations Officer they report to, who will mark it in the payroll system (which keeps track of accrued days and should include them on every pay stub).

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the Cheif Operations Officer they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.
