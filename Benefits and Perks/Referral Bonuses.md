# Referrals

Referrals from people who already work at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED are one of the best signals we can get about whether or not a candidate will be successful at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED. GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED employees understand the needs and what it’s like to work at GERMISA COMPANY LIMITED, and their relationship with the candidate means they know a lot more than we can learn during an interview process.

In order to get good referrals, everyone needs to know which positions are open, know how to start the recruiting process, have time to search their network, and feel aligned with the company incentives. Open positions should be posted on germisaltd.com/about and also in the #hiring channel so that everyone sees who we’re trying to hire.
